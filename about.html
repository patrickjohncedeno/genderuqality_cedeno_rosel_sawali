      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="flow-text grey-text text-darken-3 info">
        <p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but also a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. Despite progress over the last decades, the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030.</p>
        <p>Women and girls represent half of the worldâ€™s population and, therefore, half of its potential. However, gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. On average, women in the labor market still earn 23 percent less than men globally, and women spend about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men.</p>
        <p>Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office all remain significant barriers. These areas of inequality have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a surge in reports of sexual violence, increased care work due to school closures, and a disproportionate number of women working in health and social sectors.</p>
        <p>At the current rate, it will take an estimated 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to close gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws, 140 years for women to be represented equally in positions of power and leadership in the workplace, and 47 years to achieve equal representation in national parliaments.</p>
        <p>Political leadership, investments, and comprehensive policy reforms are needed to dismantle systemic barriers to achieving Goal 5. Gender equality is a cross-cutting objective and must be a key focus of national policies, budgets, and institutions.</p>
