  <div class="popuptext" id="popup1"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup1')">X</span><h5>Household chores and children’s care are every adult’s responsibility. Ask yourself if there is an equal division of labor in your home. The work of caring for children is still done mainly by women in much of the world. A report released by the UN in 2015 points out that women from developing countries do over three hours more of daily unpaid work (household chores and childcare) than men, while in developed countries, they do, on average, two hours more.
      According to studies, the overload of household chores can increase women’s chances of mental illnesses, besides depressing their productivity at work, consequently affecting their salaries.</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup2"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup2')">X</span><h5>Get some help and support if you know a friend or acquaintance is suffering from domestic violence or other abuse. This type of violence is not restricted to physical aggression. Verbal attacks (curses and threats) and psychological abuse (controlling, manipulative and intimidating behavior) also affect women. Often, all these things occur together. If you experience domestic violence, be aware that you are not alone. Report it!</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup3"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup3')">X</span><h5>Those responsible for children and teens need support in every society. Offering the bus seat to a pregnant woman, advocating the installation of children’s changing rooms in all bathrooms in shopping centers (not only in the women’s facilities) and asking that companies guarantee maternity and paternity leave are all necessary actions. The latest UN data, released in 2015, shows that only 53 percent of countries offer at least 14 weeks of maternity leave. Even worse, only 48 percent of countries offer any paternity leave.</h5></div>

And don’t keep quiet if you hear such comments. Talk to your colleagues, friends and family frankly and tell them to stop with the chauvinist, racist, homophobic and transphobic insults.</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup5"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup5')">X</span><h5>According to 2017 data from UN Women, only 17 countries have female heads of state and/or government. The overall average of women in legislative bodies is only 23.4 percent. Find out who the female candidates are, especially women from underrepresented communities.
      In addition to politics, consider ways to support the promotion of women and LGBTQI in the arts, sciences, sports, and other fields.</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup6"> <span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup6')">X</span> <h5>One of the main obstacles to eliminating prejudice is that people have difficulty recognizing that it really exists. Research has already proven that we all reproduce stereotypes and pre-existing notions on many topics, including gender and race. “The brain and behavioral sciences have learned a lot about our unconscious biases. W​e all have them, based on race, religion, sexual orientation and gender. The important thing is to be aware of our sexist assumptions and challenge them,” explains Lise Eliot, a neuroscience professor at the Chicago Medical School of Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science.
      So, try to pay attention to your assumptions and know that none of us is immune to making bigoted comments or holding biased attitudes. When someone points out something problematic in your speech, listen and reflect on it.</h5></div>

      A study by the Boston Consulting Group and involving 1,700 companies from eight countries showed that the more diverse the workforce, 
      the better the company’s performance on measures related to innovation. Even small changes yielded results. The survey indicated that an increase of only 2.5 percent of women in a team of managers can increase innovation revenues by 1 percent.</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup8"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup8')">X</span><h5>For every dollar a man receives, women earns an average of 70-90 cents, according to UN data. Therefore, it is important to observe and support companies that pay the same salary, benefits and bonuses to employees with equivalent positions.
      If this is not happening in your workplace, mobilize resources and contacts to request the publication of the employees’ salaries, or ask for an equal pay audit, as it has already happened in some companies in the United States, United Kingdom and other European countries.</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup9"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup9')">X</span><h5>Employees must have a safe channel to report bullying, sexual harassment and racism without being exposed or dismissed. Proven cases should be punished. In addition, April Reign explains that it is important to note “how people who are most vulnerable are represented” on the committee that investigates the allegations.</h5></div>
  <div class="popuptext" id="popup10"><span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup('popup10')">X</span><h5>Racism and prejudice at work often affect people from historically marginalized groups in the form of “microaggressions.” This means, jokes and offensive comments made without harmful intent, but that hurt people, and generate stress.
      One way to stop microaggressions is to offer training on diversity and implicit prejudice. But, as April Reign says, such trainings should include everyone. “When we talk about training, it has to start from the top down, not just the CEO or the board saying ‘okay we are going to pay for that,’ but they need to be in attendance as well,” she emphasizes.</h5>
